# How to contribute
Thank you for wanting to contribute! These are just a few guidelines that we'd like contributors to follow.

## Making changes

* Fork the repo.
* Create a branch from the develop branch and name it 'feature/name-of-feature': `git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature` (We follow [this branching model] (http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/))
* Make sure you test your new feature.
* Commit your changes together with specs for them: (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)

## Submitting changes

* Push your changes to your feature branch.
* Submit a pull request to the develop repository. Describe your feature in the pull request. Make sure you commit the specs.
* Pull request does not necessarily need to be the final, finished feature. Feel free to treat it as a base for discussion.

Thank you for contributing!
